// Operators 
// In JS there are different kinds of operators. We use this operators along with our variables
// and constants to create expressions. And with these expressions we can implement logic and algorithms
// Operators & variables --> Expressions --> Algorithms

// Different kinds of operators
// Arithmetic Operators, Assignment Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators 

// 2. Assignment Operators (=)

let x = 10;

x = x + 5;
x += 5; // This is the same as x = x + 5;

// This can be used with all other arithmetic operators

x = x * 3;
x *= 3;
