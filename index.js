// Operators 
// In JS there are different kinds of operators. We use this operators along with our variables
// and constants to create expressions. And with these expressions we can implement logic and algorithms
// Operators & variables --> Expressions --> Algorithms

// Different kinds of operators
// Arithmetic Operators, Assignment Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators 

// 1. Arithmetic Operators - used for performing calculations
// Arithmetic operators usually take upto two operands ( x, y) and return a new value.


let x = 10;
let y = 20;

console.log(x + y);  // Addition // x + y is an expression
console.log(x - y); // Subtraction
console.log(x * y); // Multiplication
console.log(x / y); // Division
console.log(x % y); // Modulus ( Remainder of x divided by y)
console.log(x ** y); // Exponentiation ( x raised to the power of y)


// Increment Operators are indicated by (++)

console.log(++x); 
console.log(x++);
console.log(x);

// Decrement Operators are indicated by (--)

console.log(--y); 
console.log(y--); 
console.log(y);
