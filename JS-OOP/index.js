// Prototypical Inheritance
// This represents a simple example of prototypical inheritance in JS

// When to Use Inheritance 
// 1. When you want to create a new object that is a specialized version of an existing object
// 2. When you want to share methods and properties between objects
// 3. When you want to create a hierarchy of objects
// 4. When you want to implement polymorphism
// 5. Do not use inheritance when you want to create a new object that is not related to an existing object
