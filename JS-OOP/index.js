// Part 2 : Object Oriented Programming

// Benefits of OOP:

// 1. Encapsulation - We group related variables and functions together and this way we can reduce complexity and increase reusability

// 2. Abstraction -  We hide the detils and the complexity and show only the essentials. This technique reduces complexity and also isolates
//                   the impact of changes in the code

// 3. Inheritance - We can eliminate redundant code

// 4. Polymorphism - We can refactor ugly switch case statements
